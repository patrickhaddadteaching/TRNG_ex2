* How the jitter variance and the number of xored oscillators impact the throughput of a MO-TRNG undistinguishable from an ideal RNG ?
  - For a given number of xored oscillators, lower the jitter variance is, lower is the nedded throughput to make the MO-TRNG undistinguishable from an ideal RNG.
  - For a given jitter variance, lower the number of xored oscillators is, lower is the nedded throughput to make the MO-TRNG undistinguishable from an ideal RNG.
